# Perpetual Humanoid Control for Real-time Simulated Avatars

Official implementation of ICCV 2023 paper: "Perpetual Humanoid Control for Real-time Simulated Avatars". In this paper, we present a physics-based humanoid controller that achieves high-fidelity motion imitation and fail-statue recovery in the presence of noisy input (e.g. pose estimates from video or generated from language) and unexpected falls. No external forces is used.

## Introduction
We present a physics-based humanoid controller that achieves high-fidelity motion imitation and fault-tolerant behavior in the presence of noisy input (e.g. pose estimates from video or generated from language) and unexpected falls. Our controller scales up to learning ten thousand motion clips without using any external stabilizing forces and learns to naturally recover from fail-state. Given reference motion, our controller can perpetually control simulated avatars without requiring resets. At its core, we propose the progressive multiplicative control policy (PMCP), which dynamically allocates new network capacity to learn harder and harder motion sequences. PMCP allows efficient scaling for learning from large-scale motion databases and adding new tasks, such as fail-state recovery, without catastrophic forgetting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our controller by using it to imitate noisy poses from video-based pose estimators and language-based motion generators in a live and real-time multi-person avatar use case.

> ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èNotice that the current released models used a different coordinate system as SMPL (with negative z as gravity direction), and the humanoid is modifed in a way such that it is facing positive x direction (instead of the original SMPL facing). This is reflected in a "up_right_start" flag in the humanoid robot (`smpl_local_robot.py`) configuration. This is done to make the humanoid's heading to be eailerly defined and flipping left and right easier, but would require further modification for converting back to SMPL (which is provided in the code). In the future I am working towards removing this modification.

### Current Results on Cleaned AMASS (11313 Sequences)

All evaluation is done using the mean SMPL body pose and adjust the height, using the same evaluation protocal as in [UHC](https://github.com/ZhengyiLuo/UniversalHumanoidControl/tree/master). Noticed that different evaluation protocal will lead to different results, and Isaac gym itself can lead to (slightly) different results based on batch size/machine setup. 

| Models         | Succ | G-MPJPE | ACC |
|----------------|:----:|:------------:|:----:|
| PHC           | 98.9% |     37.5     | 3.3 |
| PHC-KP          | 98.7% |     40.7     | 3.5 |
| PHC+ [in Pulse](https://zhengyiluo.github.io/PULSE/)  | 100% |     26.6     | 2.7 |
| PHC-Fut (using future) | 100% |     25.3     | 2.5 |

### Dependencies

To create the environment, follow the following instructions: 

1. Create new conda environment and install pytroch:


```
conda create -n isaac python=3.8
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

2. Download and setup [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym). 


3. [Optional if only inference] Download SMPL paramters from [SMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/). Put them in the `data/smpl` folder, unzip them into 'data/smpl' folder. Please download the v1.1.0 version, which contains the neutral humanoid. Rename the files `basicmodel_neutral_lbs_10_207_0_v1.1.0`, `basicmodel_m_lbs_10_207_0_v1.1.0.pkl`, `basicmodel_f_lbs_10_207_0_v1.1.0.pkl` to `SMPL_NEUTRAL.pkl`, `SMPL_MALE.pkl` and `SMPL_FEMALE.pkl`. Rename The file structure should look like this:

```

|-- data
    |-- smpl
        |-- SMPL_FEMALE.pkl
        |-- SMPL_NEUTRAL.pkl
        |-- SMPL_MALE.pkl

```


Make sure you have the SMPL paramters properly setup by running the following scripts:
```
python uhc/smpllib/smpl_local_robot.py
python scripts/joint_monkey_smpl.py
```

The SMPL model is used to adjust the height the humanoid robot to avoid penetnration with the ground during data loading. 

4. Use the following script to download trained models and sample data.

```
bash download_data.sh
```

this wil download amass_isaac_standing_upright_slim.pkl, which is a standing still pose for testing. 

To evaluate with your own SMPL data, see the script `scripts/data_process/convert_data_smpl.py`. Pay speical attention to make sure the coordinate system is the same as the one used  in simulaiton (with negative z as gravity direction). 


## Evaluation 


### Viewer Shortcuts

| Keyboard | Function |
| ---- | --- |
| f | focus on humanoid |
| Right click + WASD | change view port |
| Shift + Right click + WASD | change view port fast |
| r | reset episode |
| j | apply large force to the humanoid |
| l | record screenshot, press again to stop recording|
| ; | cancel screen shot|
| m | cancel termination based on imitation |

... more shortcut can be found in `pacer/env/tasks/base_task.py`

Notes on rendering: I am using pyvirtualdisplay to record the video such that you can see all humanoids at the same time (default function will only capture the first environment). You can disable it using the flag `--no_virtual_display`. 

You can use the `--render_o3d --no_virtual_display` flag to render the SMPL mesh together with your Isaac Gym simulation in real time like this: 
<div float="center">
  <img src="assets/open3d.gif" />
</div>

to do the above visulaization, press m (to cancel termination based on imitation), and then press j (to apply a large force to the humanoid).

## Training



### Data Processing AMASS

We train on a subset of the [AMASS](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/) dataset.

For processing the AMASS, first, download the AMASS dataset from [AMASS](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/). Then, run the following script on the unzipped data:


```
python scripts/data_process/process_amass_raw.py --dir [path_to_amass] --out_dir [out_dir]
```

which dumps the data into the `amass_db_smplh.pt` file. Then, run 

```
python scripts/data_process/process_amass_db.py
```

We further process these data into Motionlib format by running the following script:

```
python scripts/data_process/convert_amass_isaac.py
```

Which should give you 11313 sequences for trainig. 


You can also directly using the script `python scripts/data_process/convert_amass_data.py`

### Training PHC

[This section is still under contruction. Proceed with caution.]

Training PHC is not super automated yet, so it requires some (a lot of) manual steps, and invovles changing the config file a couple of times during training based on the training phase. The `phc_shape_pnn_train_iccv.yaml` config file provides a starting point for training primitives. 

First, we will train one primitive, and keep an eye on its performance (--has_eval) flag. In the config, the "training_prim" is the primitive that is being trained. This need to be updated accordingly. 

```
python phc/run_hydra.py learning=im_pnn exp_name=phc_shape_pnn_iccv env=env_im_pnn robot=smpl_humanoid_shape env.motion_file=sample_data/amass_isaac_standing_upright_slim.pkl  
```

After the performance plateaus, we will dump the most recent sequences that the primitives has failed on, and use them to train the next primitive. Here idx is the primitive that should be trained. 

```
python scripts/pmcp/forward_pmcp.py --exp phc_shape_mcp_iccv --epoch {} --idx {idx}
```
The above script will dump two files: one is the next hard sequences to learn, and anothere one is the checkpoint to resume with the copied primitive. 

To train the next primitive, run teh following script:
```
python phc/run_hydra.py learning=im_pnn exp_name=phc_shape_pnn_iccv env=env_im_pnn robot=smpl_humanoid_shape env.motion_file=sample_data/amass_isaac_standing_upright_slim.pkl epoch=[include epoch+1 from previous step] env.fitting=True env.training_prim=1
```

Repeat this process until no hard sequences are left. Then, to train the fail-state recovery primitive on simple locomotion data. 


```
python phc/run_hydra.py learning=im_pnn exp_name=phc_shape_pnn_iccv env=env_im_pnn robot=smpl_humanoid_shape env.motion_file=sample_data/amass_isaac_standing_upright_slim.pkl epoch=[include current epoch] env.fitting=True env.training_prim=3 zero_out_far=True zero_out_far_train=True getup_udpate_epoch={epoch}
```

After all primitives are trained, train the composer: 

```
python phc/run_hydra.py learning=im_mcp exp_name=phc_shape_mcp_iccv test=True env=env_im_getup_mcp robot=smpl_humanoid_shape env.z_activation=silu env.motion_file=sample_data/amass_isaac_standing_upright_slim.pkl env.models=['output/HumanoidIm/{exp_name}/Humanoid.pth']
```

When training the composer, you can repeat the process above (progressive mining hard sequences) to improve performance. 


You can also just train one model for imitation (no PNN):
```
python phc/run_hydra.py learning=im exp_name=phc_prim_iccv  env=env_im robot=smpl_humanoid_shape robot.freeze_hand=True robot.box_body=False env.motion_file=sample_data/amass_isaac_standing_upright_slim.pkl
```

## Trouble Shooting


### Multiprocessing Issues
See [this issue](https://github.com/ZhengyiLuo/PerpetualHumanoidControl/issues/17) for some discusssions. 

For the data loading part, try use 

at [this line](https://github.com/ZhengyiLuo/PerpetualHumanoidControl/blob/8e01930fbcaa3efb9fb8b4752f2cf52f41dfe260/phc/utils/motion_lib_base.py#L235), bascially, uncomment: 

```
mp.set_sharing_strategy('file_system')
```

which should fix the issue. Though using file_system has caused me problems before as well.


### Success Rate
The success rate is reported as "eval_success_rate" in the wandb logging, not the "success_rate", which is
